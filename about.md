I have a broad IT background. I started out in desktop support and worked my way up to an
infrastructure position at my first company. It is in this role that I really started to grow and
learn, sometimes the hard way, how things in the IT world work. Sometime around here penetration
testing caught my attention, and who doesn't think that sounds sexy?! Ever since then I've made
that my end goal career, because I definitely don't want to end up in management.  

I would gain experience and exposure into an area, and then grow into another position. The end
result being a very broad and diverse background of infrastructure positions. My current efforts
are focused on building out my skillset and passing the OSCP. It is an ambitious goal, but I've
already failed it...more than once... Can't stop now! Certifications aren't the goal here, really,
but I feel like it's a good measure of growth. And they certainly help open doors!   

Current certifications I hold:  
 * [GPEN][1]  
 * [GSEC][2]  
 * [GIAC Advisory Board Member][3]
